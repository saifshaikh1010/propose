      <p>
        I still remember the first day we met, It was a simple introduction, but our eyes met and the sparks flew. That eye contact we made at Katraj Chowk, wow, unbelievable! It was a close call.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then your smile hit me like a brick wall! It's been almost 1 year now since we met, and I still remember that touch under the table at our first dinner while traveling to Pune.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still remember the fun we had in my car while traveling. I still remember my favorite song which you played, and that was already my favorite! I don‚Äôt know how we were so close to sitting together there...
      </p>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt need a thousand reasons to love you; I just need one... and that's you.
